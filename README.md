# Camagru
## Description
This is a WeThinkCode_ first year web project where I had to create a website for sharing images.
You can take images using your device's camera or upload images straight from your local storage.
You can also add stickers and frames to your images.

## Requirements to run
1. Download and install XAMPP for Windows from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
2. Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads

## Running the project
1. Start XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Clone the repository into the HTDOCS folder in XAMPP.
   You will find the HTDOCS folder in the following path if you installed in on your C drive.
   C:\xampp\htdocs
3. Then Open the project on vs Code editor.
    - run php -v 
    - To setup database navigate to config folder and run php database.php followed by php setup.php
4. Go to http://localhost/camagru/ and navigate the website as you would with any other website.
